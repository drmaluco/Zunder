###### Android App for [European Blockchain Solutions](http://euroblockchain.solutions/)

**Zunder App** solves the biggest problem in the Fintech industry, the middlemen element. By implementing a revolutionary combination of cutting-edge technology such as **Blockchain, AI** and **IoT**. We are developing the first decentralized peer to peer marketplace for Fintech products and services powered by Smart Contracts.

This MVP contains the essential features for the project. Includes a Blockchain wallet based on Waves Platform, a market-place for Fintech Product and Services and a Map tracking location.

## Features

### Home page 
Information, tools and sub-apps are displayed **geometrically**. The average user receives access to in-app messaging, notifications, contacts, documentation, APIs, and a range of Fintech products and services from the market and community.

### Log in / Sign  
When new users sign up they have to go through a **e-KYC** (electronic Know Your Customer) process powered by machine learning and facial recognition. This process ensures AML and identity fraud issues.

### In-App messaging 
One of the multiple function the app provides to the user. Every message is ciphered END-to-END. The app will be powered by the Noise Protocol Framework, this supports mutual and optional authentication, identity hiding, forward secrecy, zero round-trip encryption, and other advanced features. [Noise Protocol Framework](http://noiseprotocol.org/) is used by many Apps and systems, such as WhatsApp, Inc.
